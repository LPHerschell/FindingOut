SPADE: (NARRATES) My name is Spade, Sam Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> License number three-five-
seven-eight-nine-six, issued by the police department of San Francisco<stage direction>.</stage direction> 
Occupation: private detective -- sometimes known as "private eye<stage direction>.</stage direction>" My files in 
the case of the Maltese Falcon are closed, but I've got the Maltese Falcon<stage direction>.</stage direction> I 
got it and some dough<stage direction>.</stage direction> My partner got murdered and a very slick chick went up 
<sp>for life<stage direction>.</stage direction> I'll tell you about it<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> AN ACCENT <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> THEN IN BG)</sp>

SPADE: (NARRATES) This slick dame comes to see me one day, gives me a song-
and-dance about her sister and a guy called Floyd Thursby<stage direction>.</stage direction> She wants us to get 
her sister back before her mother and father get in from Hawaii<stage direction>.</stage direction> I put my 
partner, Miles Archer, on the case<stage direction>.</stage direction> That night, he gets murdered<stage direction>.</stage direction> And so does 
<sp>this guy Thursby<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (FOOTSTEPS)</sp>

SPADE: (NARRATES) I go round to the apartment where the dame is living, the 
one called Brigid O'Shaughnessy<stage direction>.</stage direction> (CHUCKLES) She had something I seemed to go 
<sp>for<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> OUT)</sp>

<sp>BRIGID: (SURPRISED TO SEE HIM) Oh, uh, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> Come in<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: I have come in<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Oh, yes<stage direction>.</stage direction> So you have<stage direction>.</stage direction> (TROUBLED) Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade, tell 
<sp>me -- am I to blame for last night<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: You warned us that Thursby was dangerous<stage direction>.</stage direction> Of course, you lied to us 
<sp>about your sister and all that, but that doesn't count<stage direction>.</stage direction> We didn't believe you<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: Ohh<stage direction>.</stage direction> Help me, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> I - I need help so badly<stage direction>.</stage direction> I've no right to 
<sp>ask you but I do ask you<stage direction>.</stage direction> Help me<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: (CHUCKLES) You won't need much of anybody's help<stage direction>.</stage direction> You're good<stage direction>.</stage direction> You're 
awful good<stage direction>.</stage direction> It's chiefly your eyes, I think, and that throb you get into your 
<sp>voice when you say things like - (MIMICS HER) "Help me, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction>"</sp>

BRIGID: I deserve that<stage direction>.</stage direction> But, oh, the lie was in the WAY I said it and - not at 
<sp>all in what I said<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

SPADE: If I'm going to help you, I've got to have some sort of a line on your 
<sp>Floyd Thursby<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: I met him in the Orient<stage direction>.</stage direction> We came here from Hong Kong last week<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Did he kill Archer<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: Yes, certainly<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Picked a nice sort of playmate<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: Only that sort could have helped me if - if he had been loyal<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: How bad a hole are you actually in<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: As bad as could be<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Physical danger<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: I'm not heroic<stage direction>.</stage direction> I don't think there's anything worse than death<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Then it's that<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: It's that as surely as we're sitting here<stage direction>.</stage direction> Unless you help me<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Who killed Thursby<stage direction>?</stage direction> Your enemies or his<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: I don't know<stage direction>.</stage direction> His, I suppose<stage direction>.</stage direction> I'm afraid, I don't know<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Who ARE these enemies<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: (EVASIVE) Well, there's a small, dark man with white teeth and a 
<sp>smooth, dangerous fat man<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Oh, this is hopeless<stage direction>.</stage direction> Well, how much money have you got<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: I've about five hundred dollars left<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Give it to me<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SOUND: (FOOTSTEPS AWAY <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> DRAWER OPENS AND CLOSES <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> FOOTSTEPS RETURN <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> 
<sp>SPADE COUNTS THE MONEY)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: There's only four hundred here<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: (DEFENSIVE) I had to keep some to live on<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: (RELENTS) Okay<stage direction>.</stage direction> I'll be back as soon as I can<stage direction>.</stage direction> You needn't come to the 
<sp>door with me<stage direction>.</stage direction> I can let myself out<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> A BRIDGE, THEN IN BG)</sp>

SPADE: (NARRATES) I went by the office then and found a dark little guy with 
<sp>very white teeth waiting for me<stage direction>.</stage direction> His name was Joel Cairo<stage direction>.</stage direction> He was a Greek<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> OUT)</sp>

<sp>SOUND: (DOOR SHUTS)</sp>

CAIRO: (MOUSY, WITH AN ALLEGEDLY GREEK ACCENT) Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade, I'm trying to 
recover an - an ornament that has been, shall we say, mislaid<stage direction>.</stage direction> I thought and 
<sp>hoped you could assist me<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>SPADE: Uh huh<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

CAIRO: The ornament is a statuette, the black figure of a bird<stage direction>.</stage direction> I am prepared 
to pay the sum of five thousand dollars for its recovery -- and no questions 
<sp>asked<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Five thousand's a lot of money<stage direction>.</stage direction> It's a very interesting figure--</sp>

<sp>CAIRO: You will put your hands together, back of your neck, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>SPADE: Huh<stage direction>?</stage direction> Oh, sure<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

CAIRO: I shall shoot you if you try to stop me, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> But I must search 
<sp>your office<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: You won't find anything but a pair of worn out rubbers, a half-pint of 
<sp>rum and a pack o' chewing gum<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>CAIRO: We shall see<stage direction>.</stage direction> Please stand up<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (CHAIR SQUEAKS AS SPADE RISES <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> FOOTSTEPS TO CAIRO)</sp>

<sp>CAIRO: (DIRECTS HIM WHERE TO STAND) So<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Sure<stage direction>.</stage direction> This way<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>CAIRO: No<stage direction>.</stage direction> The other way<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Sure<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (SPADE PUNCHES CAIRO, KNOCKS HIM DOWN)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: I'll take the gun, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Cairo<stage direction>.</stage direction> Now, get up<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (CAIRO RISES)</sp>

<sp>CAIRO: (WEAKLY) I am very slow at things like that, unfortunately<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: (AMUSED) Yeah<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

CAIRO: I'm still prepared to pay five thousand dollars for the return of the 
<sp>figure<stage direction>.</stage direction> Do you have it, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: No<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

CAIRO: (CONFUSED) If it is not here, why did you just risk serious injury to 
<sp>prevent my searching for it<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Well, I should sit around and let people come in and stick me up<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>CAIRO: You wish some assurance of my sincerity<stage direction>?</stage direction> A retainer<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: I might<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>CAIRO: Say, one hundred dollars<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (WHIPS OUT SOME CASH)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: Ah, ya better make it two hundred<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>SOUND: (MONEY CHANGES HANDS)</sp>

SPADE: Thanks<stage direction>.</stage direction> Your first guess was that I had the bird<stage direction>.</stage direction> What's your second 
<sp>guess<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>CAIRO: That you know where it is, or where you can get it<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: You're not hiring me to murder or do burglary but to get back the 
figure in some lawful way<stage direction>?</stage direction> Say, from a dame with red hair<stage direction>?</stage direction> Or a smooth, 
<sp>dangerous fat man<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

CAIRO: Oh, so you know<stage direction>?</stage direction> You must beware of them<stage direction>.</stage direction> They would stop at nothing<stage direction>.</stage direction> 
<sp>May - may I have my pistol now<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: (CHUCKLES) Yeah, yeah, sure<stage direction>.</stage direction> I'd forgotten it<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

CAIRO: Thank you<stage direction>.</stage direction> Now, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade, you will kindly clasp your hands behind your 
<sp>neck<stage direction>?</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>SPADE: What the--<stage direction>?</stage direction> (STARTS TO LAUGH)</sp>

CAIRO: Don't move, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> This time, I might shoot<stage direction>.</stage direction> I insist on searching 
<sp>your office<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: (STILL LAUGHING) Sure! Go ahead!</sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> A BRIEF BRIDGE <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> THEN IN BG)</sp>

SPADE: (NARRATES) I finally got rid of the Greek and started back for Brigid 
O'Shaughnessy's apartment<stage direction>.</stage direction> Matter of fact, I had a hunch that the Greek was 
going there himself and started to tail his cab when a sad-faced guy poked 
<sp>something into my back and said:</sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> AN ACCENT <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> THEN OUT)</sp>

<sp>WILMER: Come on<stage direction>.</stage direction> The Fat Man wants yo see ya<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> AN ACCENT, A BRIEF BRIDGE <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> THEN IN OUT)</sp>

WILMER: Here he is, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Gutman -- the guy who was talkin' to the dame and the 
<sp>Greek<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: (ENGLISH ACCENT) Ah! Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade!</sp>

<sp>SPADE: (PLEASANTLY) Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Gutman<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: We begin well, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction> I distrust a man who talks too much<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: I like to talk<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Of course, talking's something you can't do judiciously - unless you 
<sp>keep in practice<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>SPADE: Yeah<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Now, sir, we'll talk if you like<stage direction>.</stage direction> And I'll tell you right out that I'm 
<sp>a man [who] likes talking to a man who likes to talk<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Swell<stage direction>.</stage direction> Will we talk about the black bird<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: You're the man for me, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction> No beating about the bush, right to the 
point<stage direction>.</stage direction> Let us talk about the black bird, by all means<stage direction>.</stage direction> Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade, have you any 
<sp>conception of how much money can be got for that black bird<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: No<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Well, sir, if I told you -- if I told you half, you'd call me a liar<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: (WITH A CHUCKLE) No, no<stage direction>.</stage direction> Not even if I thought so<stage direction>.</stage direction> But you just tell me 
<sp>what it is and I'll figure out the profits<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: You mean you don't know what that bird is<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: Well, I know what it's supposed to look like<stage direction>.</stage direction> I know the value in human 
<sp>life you people put on it<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Miss O'Shaughnessy didn't tell you what it is<stage direction>?</stage direction> And Cairo didn't, 
<sp>either<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: He offered me ten thousand for it<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: (SCOFFS) Ten thousand! (CHUCKLES) And dollars, mind you, not even 
pounds<stage direction>.</stage direction> (SERIOUS) They must know what it is<stage direction>.</stage direction> Or do they<stage direction>?</stage direction> What is your 
<sp>impression<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: I can't tell<stage direction>.</stage direction> They're both lying<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: If they don't know, I'm the only one in the whole wide, sweet world 
<sp>who does<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Swell<stage direction>.</stage direction> When you've told me, that'll make two of us<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Mathematically correct, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction> But I don't know for certain that I'm 
<sp>going to tell you<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: Oh, don't be foolish<stage direction>.</stage direction> You know what it is and I know where it is<stage direction>.</stage direction> 
<sp>That's why I'm here<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Well, sir, where is it<stage direction>?</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>SPADE: (CHUCKLES) Don't be silly<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: You see, I must tell you what I know but you will not tell me what you 
know<stage direction>.</stage direction> That is hardly equitable, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction> No, no<stage direction>.</stage direction> I don't think we can do business 
<sp>along those lines<stage direction>.</stage direction>             </sp>

SPADE: (SUDDENLY VIOLENTLY ANGRY) Yeah<stage direction>?</stage direction> Well, think again and think fast<stage direction>.</stage direction> I 
can get along without you! And keep that gunsel away from me while you're 
makin' up your mind! I'll kill him!
 
<sp>GUTMAN: Well, sir, I must say you have a most violent temper<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: Well, what are you wasting time for<stage direction>?</stage direction>! You've got till 5:30, then you're 
<sp>either in or out for keeps!</sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> A BRIDGE <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> THEN IN BG)</sp>

SPADE: (NARRATES) Three characters and a black bird<stage direction>.</stage direction> Well, all I knew was, my 
partner was dead and the cops were getting very uncooperative about the whole 
thing, including "who killed Floyd Thursby<stage direction>?</stage direction>" I thought I'd better get back to 
see that O'Shaughnessy dame before it was too late<stage direction>.</stage direction> And, sure enough, it 
<sp>almost was<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: They came here and took him away<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Took who away<stage direction>?</stage direction> Who<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: The police<stage direction>.</stage direction> They - they wanted to talk to you, too<stage direction>.</stage direction> They took Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> 
<sp>Cairo with them<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: What was HE doing here<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: (EVASIVE) He came to talk about the bird<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: Hey, what IS this bird, this falcon, that everybody's all steamed up 
<sp>about<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: Suppose I wouldn't tell you anything at all about it<stage direction>?</stage direction> What would you 
<sp>do<stage direction>?</stage direction> Something wild and unpredictable<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Maybe<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: Well, it's a black figure, as you know -- smooth and shiny, of a bird 
<sp>-- a hawk or falcon, about twelve inches high<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Well, what makes it so important<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: I don't know<stage direction>.</stage direction> They wouldn't tell me<stage direction>.</stage direction> But they promised me five hundred 
<sp>pounds if I helped them get it from the man who had it<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Go ahead<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: They promised me five hundred pounds to help them and I did<stage direction>.</stage direction> Then we 
found that Joel Cairo was going to take the falcon and desert Floyd and me, so 
<sp>we - did that to Joel first<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: You ARE a liar<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: (AFTER A BEAT, AGREES) I am a liar<stage direction>.</stage direction> I've always been a liar<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: (CHUCKLES) Well, don't brag about it<stage direction>.</stage direction> Is there any truth at all in that 
<sp>yarn<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: Some<stage direction>.</stage direction> Not very much<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: Well, we've got plenty of time<stage direction>.</stage direction> I'll put some coffee on and we'll try 
<sp>again<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: (SIGHS) Oh, I'm so tired<stage direction>.</stage direction> So tired of lying and thinking up lies, and 
- not knowing what is a lie and what is the truth<stage direction>.</stage direction> Oh, darling, don't stare at 
<sp>me like that<stage direction>.</stage direction> Come closer, darling<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: It IS something to do while waiting<stage direction>.</stage direction> (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Why not<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: Kiss me, Sam Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> Kiss me<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Why not<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (DOORBELL BUZZES)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: Ah, it happens every time<stage direction>.</stage direction> I'll get it<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: Be careful, darling<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (FOOTSTEPS <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> UNLOCKS DOOR <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> OPENS DOOR)</sp>

<sp>WILMER: Okay<stage direction>.</stage direction> Come on, you<stage direction>.</stage direction> He wants to see you<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: Well, if it isn't the Fat Man's killer! Hello, paleface -- how many'd 
<sp>you bump off today<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>WILMER: Shut up! Gutman's waiting for you<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: No kidding<stage direction>.</stage direction> What kept ya<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: Darling, what does he want<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: He wants me<stage direction>.</stage direction> The Fat Man's been thinking things over<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> A BRIEF BRIDGE <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> IN AND OUT)</sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Well, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade, I must apologize for sending for you in this fashion<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Ah, never mind<stage direction>.</stage direction> Let's talk about the bird<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: All right<stage direction>.</stage direction> Let's<stage direction>.</stage direction> What do you think of the Order of the Hospital of 
<sp>Saint John of Jerusalem<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Crusaders or something, weren't they<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Very good<stage direction>.</stage direction> In 1539, these crusading knights persuaded Emperor Charles 
V to give them the island of Malta<stage direction>.</stage direction> He made but one condition<stage direction>.</stage direction> They were to 
pay him each year the tribute of a falcon - in acknowledgment that Malta was 
<sp>still under Spain<stage direction>.</stage direction> Do you follow me<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Yeah<stage direction>.</stage direction>  </sp>

GUTMAN: Have you any conception of the extreme, immeasurable wealth of the 
<sp>Order of that time<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Well, I imagine they were pretty well fixed<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: They were rolling in wealth, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction> They hit upon the happy thought of 
sending the emperor for the first year's tribute, not an insignificant live 
bird, but a glorious golden falcon, encrusted from head to foot with the 
<sp>finest jewels in their coffers<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>SOUND: (GLASSES CLINK)</sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Allow me to replenish your drink, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (DRINK POURED)</sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Well, what do you think of these knights<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: I don't know<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Well, sir, the glorious falcon never reached Spain<stage direction>.</stage direction> Buccaneers raided 
the galleon<stage direction>.</stage direction> In 1713, the bird showed up in Sicily<stage direction>.</stage direction> In 1840, in Paris<stage direction>.</stage direction> And it 
had by that time, acquired a coat of black enamel, looking like nothing but a 
fairly interesting black statue<stage direction>.</stage direction> In 1923, a Greek dealer found it in an 
obscure Paris shop<stage direction>.</stage direction> He knew what it was<stage direction>.</stage direction> I heard about it in London and rushed  
over to buy it<stage direction>.</stage direction> But the Greek was murdered and the falcon gone<stage direction>.</stage direction> That was 
twenty-three years ago<stage direction>.</stage direction> For twenty-three years, I've searched for the bird<stage direction>.</stage direction> I 
traced it to the home of a Russian general, Kemidov, but he wouldn't sell, 
even though he knew nothing of its value<stage direction>.</stage direction> I was forced to send my agents after 
it<stage direction>.</stage direction> They got it, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction> But I haven't got it<stage direction>.</stage direction> But I'm going to get it, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction> Um, 
<sp>how soon can you, uh, how soon are you willing to produce the falcon<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: (INCREASINGLY GROGGY) Uh, couple of days<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: That is satisfactory<stage direction>.</stage direction> Well, sir, here's a fair bargain and profits 
<sp>large enough for both of us<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: What's your idea of a fair bargain<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Shall I say one hundred thousand<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Why not<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: What do you say to a quarter of a million<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Oh, then you think the dingus is worth a million, huh<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Why not<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Yeah<stage direction>.</stage direction> Why not<stage direction>?</stage direction> Say, I - I feel kind of funny, Gutman<stage direction>.</stage direction> That drink<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: My dear man, how could you suggest anything so crude<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (SPADE DROPS HIS GLASS WHICH SHATTERS ON THE FLOOR)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: I-- I-- (EXHALES)</sp>

<sp>SOUND: (SPADE COLLAPSES UNCONSCIOUS TO THE FLOOR)</sp>

GUTMAN: Put your guns away, Wilmer<stage direction>.</stage direction> You must learn to be subtle in these 
<sp>things<stage direction>.</stage direction> Like me<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

WILMER: Out like a light, huh<stage direction>?</stage direction> Well, I owe him something, the louse -- he 
<sp>thinks he's tough<stage direction>.</stage direction> Let's see if he can take this<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (WILMER KICKS SPADE -- FIVE TIMES)</sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: That's enough, Wilmer<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>WILMER: (EXHALES)</sp>

GUTMAN: You've kicked him enough<stage direction>.</stage direction> It'd never do to kill him here<stage direction>.</stage direction> Besides, 
<sp>Wilmer, you know - how I hate the sight of blood<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>Greenstreet<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> TRANSITIONS TO A BRIDGE, THEN UNDER)</sp>

SPADE: (NARRATES) I guess the name of Sam Spade was a cinch for the back page 
obituaries -- but I came out of it somehow and managed to get up and stagger 
<sp>out of that apartment<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

I went around to the hotel where Joel Cairo had a room and made a deal with 
the house dick to let me search it<stage direction>.</stage direction> All I could find was a newspaper in the 
wastebasket folded back to the steamship news<stage direction>.</stage direction> There was a list of arrivals 
and one was marked<stage direction>.</stage direction> It said, "Eight seven A<stage direction>.</stage direction> M<stage direction>.</stage direction> -- the La Paloma from Hong 
Kong<stage direction>.</stage direction>" That was good enough for me<stage direction>.</stage direction> I got a cab and rode to the docks<stage direction>.</stage direction> The La 
Paloma was on fire and burning beautifully<stage direction>.</stage direction> I went back to my office to hold 
<sp>my aching head and think things over when the door opened <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (DOOR OPENS)</sp>

SPADE: (NARRATES) <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> and a tall guy in a long black overcoat stood there with 
<sp>a package in his hands, making gurgling noises, before he fell like a tree<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>SOUND: (MAN AND PACKAGE FALL - LIKE A TREE - TO THE FLOOR)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: (NARRATES) He should have<stage direction>.</stage direction> He was dead<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> AN ACCENT, THEN OUT)</sp>

<sp>SOUND: (PHONE RINGS)</sp>

SPADE: (NARRATES) I took a good look at him<stage direction>.</stage direction> He was a mate off the La Paloma<stage direction>.</stage direction> 
<sp>I unwrapped his package and there it was<stage direction>.</stage direction> The black bird<stage direction>.</stage direction> The Maltese Falcon<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> AN ACCENT, THEN UNDER)</sp>

<sp>SOUND: (SPADE PICKS UP PHONE)</sp>

SPADE: (NARRATES) I grabbed the phone and listened<stage direction>.</stage direction> It was Brigid 
O'Shaughnessy and she said she was in trouble<stage direction>.</stage direction> I found her shivering in the 
dark corner of an office building and I took her and the falcon home to my 
<sp>apartment<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (APARTMENT DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> FOOTSTEPS)</sp>

SPADE: (NARRATES) I put her on the couch<stage direction>.</stage direction> I put the falcon in the icebox -- 
where no one would think to look for anything, including ice<stage direction>.</stage direction> I came back in 
<sp>and switched on the lights <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: (NARRATES) <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> and found a surprise party waiting to greet me<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> OUT)</sp>

GUTMAN: Well, sir, we're all here<stage direction>.</stage direction> Now, let's sit down and be comfortable and 
<sp>talk<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: Sure<stage direction>.</stage direction> (SHARPLY, TO WILMER) Get away from me, gunsel! You're not gonna 
<sp>frisk me!</sp>

<sp>WILMER: Stand still! Shut up!</sp>

SPADE: Put your paw on me and I'm gonna make you use that gun<stage direction>.</stage direction> Ask your boss 
<sp>if he wants me shot up before we talk<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Never mind, Wilmer<stage direction>.</stage direction> You're certainly a most headstrong individual, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> 
<sp>Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> Well, let's be seated<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: You, too, Cairo<stage direction>.</stage direction> You can put down your gun, too<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>CAIRO: Of course, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> I was only using caution, as it were<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: You ready, Gutman<stage direction>?</stage direction> Are you ready to make the first payment and take the 
<sp>falcon off my hands<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Well, sir, as to that, here are ten thousand dollars, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Oh<stage direction>?</stage direction> We were talking about more money than this<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Yes, sir, we were<stage direction>.</stage direction> But this is genuine coin of the realm, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction> With a 
dollar of this you can buy ten dollars of talk and, besides, there are more of 
<sp>us to be taken care of now<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Well, that may be<stage direction>.</stage direction> But I'VE got the falcon<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

CAIRO: I should not think it would be necessary to remind you, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade, that 
<sp>though you may have the falcon, yet we certainly have you<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: Yes, I'm trying not to let that worry me<stage direction>.</stage direction> We'll come to the money 
later<stage direction>.</stage direction> There's another thing to be taken care of first<stage direction>.</stage direction> We've got to have a 
"fall guy<stage direction>.</stage direction>" The police have to have a victim<stage direction>.</stage direction> Somebody they can stick for 
<sp>those three murders<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

CAIRO: Two<stage direction>.</stage direction> Only two murders, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> Thursby undoubtedly killed your 
<sp>partner<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: All right<stage direction>.</stage direction> Two<stage direction>.</stage direction> What difference does it make<stage direction>?</stage direction> The point is, we've got 
<sp>to give the police--</sp>

GUTMAN: Come, come, Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade<stage direction>.</stage direction> You can't expect us to believe at this late 
date you are the least afraid of the police<stage direction>.</stage direction> Or that you're not able to 
<sp>handle--</sp>

SPADE: I'm up to my neck, Gutman<stage direction>.</stage direction> I've got to come through with somebody, a 
victim, when the time comes<stage direction>.</stage direction> If I don't, I'll be it<stage direction>.</stage direction> Let's give 'em the 
gunsel<stage direction>.</stage direction> He actually did shoot Thursby and the other one, didn't he<stage direction>?</stage direction> Anyway, 
<sp>he's made to order for the part<stage direction>.</stage direction> Let's turn him over to the cops<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (WILMER RISES)</sp>

WILMER: (SAVAGE) Get up on your feet! I've taken all the riding from you I'm 
<sp>gonna take<stage direction>.</stage direction> Get up, shoot it out!</sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Now, now, Wilmer, don't shoot--!</sp>

<sp>SOUND: (SPADE SLUGS WILMER WHO FALLS TO FLOOR UNCONSCIOUS)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: There<stage direction>.</stage direction> There, gunsel, that'll take care of you<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (FOOTSTEPS AS WILMER IS MOVED TO SOFA)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: Put 'em on the sofa<stage direction>.</stage direction> Sorry, Brigid, but you seem to have recovered<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: I'm - I'm all right<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: Good<stage direction>.</stage direction> Well, gentlemen, there's our fall guy<stage direction>.</stage direction> And now, gentlemen, you 
<sp>agree - or I'll turn the falcon and the whole lot of you in<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Mr<stage direction>.</stage direction> Spade, I don't like this<stage direction>.</stage direction> What if we, uh, took matters into our 
<sp>own hands and killed you<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: You won't<stage direction>.</stage direction> Or you'll never find the falcon<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: True, but there are other ways<stage direction>.</stage direction> We could make you talk<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: No, I'd take it and make you kill me and then you'd end up the same 
<sp>way<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: (LAUGHS) I believe you would, too<stage direction>.</stage direction> (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: Well<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: I've always felt toward Wilmer like a father<stage direction>.</stage direction> But you can have him<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Swell<stage direction>.</stage direction> Let's get the details fixed<stage direction>.</stage direction> Why did he shoot Thursby<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's ally<stage direction>.</stage direction> We thought, in disposing of 
him, we would teach Miss O'Shaughnessy to patch up her differences with us 
<sp>regarding the falcon<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: And the mate from the La Paloma<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: That was Miss O'Shaughnessy's fault<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: (GASPS)</sp>

GUTMAN: Cairo got in touch with me when he saw the notice of the ship's 
arrival<stage direction>.</stage direction> He remembered that the mate and Miss O'Shaughnessy had been friendly 
in Hong Kong<stage direction>.</stage direction> He called on this man but he, with Miss O'Shaughnessy and the 
bird, slipped through our fingers<stage direction>.</stage direction> We followed them to her apartment and 
Wilmer shot the mate as he was coming down the fire escape<stage direction>.</stage direction> He shot him many 
times but the man was tough and he did not drop the falcon<stage direction>.</stage direction> We, um, persuaded 
Miss O'Shaughnessy to call your office<stage direction>.</stage direction> But, unfortunately, she did not call 
<sp>in time to prevent you from meeting the mate and getting the falcon<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: I see<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

GUTMAN: And now, sir, er, would it be presumptuous if we asked to see the 
<sp>falcon<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Okay<stage direction>.</stage direction> It's in my icebox<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (CAIRO'S FOOTSTEPS TO THE ICEBOX)</sp>

GUTMAN: Icebox<stage direction>?</stage direction>! I say<stage direction>.</stage direction> (LAUGHS)  You ARE a character, sir! Yes, very, very 
<sp>clever of you, very<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (ICEBOX DOOR OPENS)</sp>

<sp>CAIRO: I've got it! I've got it!</sp>

<sp>SOUND: (ICEBOX DOOR SHUTS <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> CAIRO'S FOOTSTEPS RETURN)</sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Bring it in here, at once<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (UNWRAPS THE PACKAGE)</sp>

<sp>CAIRO: Here, wrapped in this <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Now after twenty-three years<stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (UNWRAPPING STOPS, A PAUSE)</sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Ah! It is it! But we'll make sure<stage direction>.</stage direction> Hand me your knife, sir<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>CAIRO: Here<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: I'll peel off some of this - disfiguring enamel<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SOUND: (KNIFE SCRAPES THE ENAMEL)</sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: (WHISPERS IN HORROR) It's--! It's a fake!</sp>

<sp>BRIGID: (GASPS)</sp>

SPADE: All right, O'Shaughnessy, you've had your little joke<stage direction>.</stage direction> Now, tell us 
<sp>about it<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: No, Sam, no! That's the one I got from the Russian, I swear!</sp>

CAIRO: You bungled it, Gutman -- you and your stupid attempt to buy it<stage direction>.</stage direction> The 
Russian caught on how valuable it was<stage direction>.</stage direction> No wonder we had so little trouble 
<sp>stealing it<stage direction>.</stage direction> You imbecile! You bloated idiot! </sp>

GUTMAN: Yes<stage direction>.</stage direction> This is the Russian's hand, there's no doubt of it<stage direction>.</stage direction> Well sir, 
what do you suggest<stage direction>?</stage direction> Shall we stand here and shed tears and call each other 
<sp>names<stage direction>?</stage direction> Or shall we go to Istanbul and interview our Russian friend<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>CAIRO: Go to Istanbul<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: For twenty-three years I wanted that little item and have been trying 
to get it<stage direction>.</stage direction> If I must spend another year on the quest, well, that will be an 
<sp>added expenditure in time only<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>CAIRO: I'll go with you<stage direction>.</stage direction> Wilmer's gone! </sp>

GUTMAN: Wilmer's gone<stage direction>?</stage direction> So he has<stage direction>.</stage direction> That makes it imperative that we go, too<stage direction>.</stage direction> 
(TO SPADE) Oh, by the way, sir, I'll trouble you for my envelope containing 
<sp>the ten thousand dollars<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: I kept my end of the bargain, but - I'll settle for a thousand for 
<sp>expenses<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>GUTMAN: Thank you<stage direction>.</stage direction> I'll allow you the thousand<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: That'll take care of my time<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

GUTMAN: Now, sir, we'll say goodbye to you - unless you care to undertake the 
Istanbul expedition with us<stage direction>.</stage direction> You don't<stage direction>?</stage direction> That's too bad<stage direction>.</stage direction> Well, sir, the 
shortest farewells are best<stage direction>.</stage direction> Adieu! And, to you, Miss O'Shaughnessy, I leave 
the rara avis there on the table there as a little memento -- the Maltese 
<sp>Falcon<stage direction>.</stage direction> (BURSTS OUT LAUGHING)</sp>

<sp>(MUSIC <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> A BRIDGE <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> THEN OUT)</sp>

<sp>SPADE: All right, O'Shaughnessy -- talk!</sp>

<sp>BRIGID: Where shall I begin<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: You came to me and asked me to have Thursby followed<stage direction>.</stage direction> I put my partner 
on it<stage direction>.</stage direction> He followed Thursby<stage direction>.</stage direction> He was killed<stage direction>.</stage direction> You must have told Thursby he was 
<sp>being followed<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: I told him, yes, but, please believe me, Sam, I wouldn't have told him 
<sp>if I'd thought Floyd Thursby would kill your partner<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: Miles hadn't many brains but he'd had too many years experience as a 
detective to be caught like that by a man he was shadowing up a blind alley 
with his gun tucked away in his hip and his overcoat buttoned<stage direction>.</stage direction> But he'd have 
<sp>gone up there with you, angel<stage direction>.</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>BRIGID: (SHIVERS)</sp>

SPADE: He was just dumb enough for that<stage direction>.</stage direction> And then you could have stood as 
<sp>close to him in the dark as you liked and put a bullet through him<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: Don't! Don't talk like that to me, Sam! You KNOW I didn't know--!</sp>

<sp>SPADE: Stop it! Why did you shoot him<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: (DISTRAUGHT) I didn't mean to at first<stage direction>.</stage direction> I - I can't look at you and 
<sp>tell you this, Sam<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: You thought Thursby would tackle him<stage direction>.</stage direction> If he got Thursby, then you were 
rid of him<stage direction>.</stage direction> If Thursby won, you had something on him<stage direction>.</stage direction> Enough to be rid of him 
<sp>for good<stage direction>.</stage direction> Wasn't that it<stage direction>?</stage direction> </sp>

<sp>BRIGID: (SOBS) Something like that<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: But when Thursby backed down, you took the gun and did the job 
<sp>yourself<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: Oh, Sam, sweetheart! From the very first instant I saw you, I knew--!</sp>

SPADE: You angel<stage direction>.</stage direction> Well, if you get a good break, you'll be out of San Quentin 
in twenty years and you can come back to me then<stage direction>.</stage direction> I hope they don't hang you, 
<sp>precious, by that sweet neck<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

BRIGID: You know deep down in your heart that in spite of anything I've done I 
<sp>love you<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

SPADE: I don't care who loves who<stage direction>.</stage direction> I'm not going to play the sap for you<stage direction>.</stage direction> I 
won't walk in Thursby's and I don't know how many other's footsteps<stage direction>.</stage direction> You 
<sp>killed my partner and you're going over for it!</sp>

BRIGID: Why must you do this to me Sam<stage direction>?</stage direction>! Surely, your partner wasn't as much 
<sp>to you as--!</sp>

SPADE: Listen! Listen to me! This won't do any good<stage direction>.</stage direction> You'll never understand 
me but I'll try once and then give it up<stage direction>.</stage direction> Listen<stage direction>.</stage direction> When a man's partner is 
killed, he's supposed to do something about it<stage direction>.</stage direction> And it happens we're in the 
detective business<stage direction>.</stage direction> Well, when one of your organization gets killed, it's - 
bad business to let the killer get away with it<stage direction>.</stage direction> Bad all around<stage direction>.</stage direction> Bad for every 
<sp>detective everywhere<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: You can't send me to the--! Sam! You can't! You love me! You love me! </sp>

SPADE: (SIGHS) Maybe I do<stage direction>.</stage direction> What of it<stage direction>?</stage direction> Maybe next month I won't<stage direction>.</stage direction> I've been 
through it before<stage direction>.</stage direction> I'll have some rotten nights after I've sent you over, but 
that'll pass<stage direction>.</stage direction> I want you, sure, but I won't take you at the price because - 
because all of me wants to, regardless of consequences<stage direction>.</stage direction> And because you 
<sp>counted on that with me, the same as you counted on that with all the others<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: Oh, Sam! Darling <stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction><stage direction>.</stage direction> Kiss me, kiss me<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: Sure<stage direction>.</stage direction> Sure, baby<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>

<sp>BRIGID: What are you doing<stage direction>?</stage direction> Who are you calling<stage direction>?</stage direction></sp>

<sp>SPADE: The cops, baby<stage direction>.</stage direction> The cops to come and - take you away<stage direction>.</stage direction></sp>
